### Why I Picked This Article:
<br>
    I picked this article because it anticipates where Software Engineering is going as an industry based on the current trends. It covers different fields of interest like Generative AI, DevSecOps, omnichannel experiences, the API economy and more. I also find it interesting how it emphasizes the growth of low code/no code platforms. I have mixed feelings about coding becoming easier & more accessible as someone studying to become a software engineer one day since this trend could make our jobs less necessary. However, I find this growing field exciting since it can make it possible for younger people to create websites & apps.

    I also found the article’s exploration of the the API economy interesting since I’ve utilized API’s like Google Maps API and OpenAI in past side projects. I like using API since it gives regular people access to immensely powerful technologies, and lets them experiment with them. Furthermore, I am curious to learn more about how the API Economy will create a drive towards more event-driven architecture. I also think it is interesting that websites/applications are going to have to be Mobile First. I am curious to find out how this changes design when most languages & resources were originally built to support traffic from laptops rather than small mobile devices.
